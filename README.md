# What is AI Cycling Coach

AI Cycling Coach utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo Preview to analyze your fitness and assist you in achieving your goals.
Once authorized, it synchronizes with your Strava account to access your activity and fitness data, such as heart rate and power zones.
After every ride, the AI Cycling Coach will analyze your activity and email you insights, recovery tips, and a training plan.
